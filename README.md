# Data-First Manifesto

In the spirit of the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/),
we are seeking to develop more agile, collaborative, efficient, and
transparent practices in digital scholarship. To those ends, we propose
emphasizing:

* **Data Serializations** over Databases

* **Application Programming Interfaces** over Graphic User Interfaces

* **Curating Data** over Summarizing Information

* **Citing Datasets** over Referring to Results

In the words of the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/),
"That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
items on the left more."
